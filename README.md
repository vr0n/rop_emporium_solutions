# PLEASE DON'T USE THIS REPO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ANSWERS!!!

# Why?

Finally going through using the `pwntools` library, I decided to test it all out
on the ROP Emporium [https://ropemporium.com/] challenges.

The goal is to learn and pass on knowledge of ROP chains and how to build them,
specifically with the pwntools library. I used gdb and radare2 to do all analysis
prior to the actual execution of the exploit.

# What?

I have heavily commented the solution files in an attempt to actually explain
what is going on.

All solutions *should* be as simple to run as `python3 exploit.py` from the 
corresponding directory.

I will try to do as many different architectures as possible, but I am starting
with x86_64 bit only.
